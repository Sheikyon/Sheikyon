# Hello stranger! I'm Sheikyon. ðŸ‘‹

Pessimistic computer scientist, formalist mathematician and amateur full-stack developer living in Gran Canaria (UTC+00:00). Potential ~~hacker~~. I speak Spanish, German and English and communicate textually Python, JavaScript, TypeScript + Node. js, Ruby, Fortran, CSS + SCSS/SASS and HTML. I also work with technologies like Mathjax to make it easy to display mathematical formulas expressed in LaTeX on my website, and in other places that require it.
