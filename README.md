# Hello stranger! I'm Sheikyon. ðŸ‘‹

Pessimistic computer scientist, formalist mathematician and amateur full-stack developer living in Gran Canaria ((UTC+00:00). Potential ~~hacker~~. I speak Spanish, German and English and communicate textually Python, JavaScript, TypeScript + Node. js, Ruby, Fortran, CSS + SCSS/SASS and HTML. I also work with technologies like Mathjax to make it easy to display mathematical formulas expressed in LaTeX on my website, and in other places that require it.

  <li><span><strong>Laziness</span></strong>: It is the quality that makes you make a great effort to reduce the total energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people find useful, and document what you write so you don't have to answer a lot of questions about it.</li>
  <li><span><strong>Impatience</span></strong>: The anger felt when the computer is getting lazy. This makes you write programs that not only react to your needs, but anticipate them. Or at least they pretend to.</li>
  <li><span><strong>Hubris</span></strong>: Excessive pride, is the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people can't say bad things about.</li>
